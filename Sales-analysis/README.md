<h1>Sales Analysis with SQL and Tableau</h1>
<p>The main objective of this project is to extract information about sales in different countries and throughout time, using the 
    <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs">Microsoft's Northwind dataset</a>.</p>

<h2>About Dataset</h2>
<p>The Northwind database is a sample database that was originally created by Microsoft and used as the basis for their tutorials in a variety of database products for decades. The Northwind database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. The Northwind database is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting. The Northwind database has since been ported to a variety of non-Microsoft databases, including PostgreSQL.</p>

<h2>Tableau Public Dashboard for visualization</h2>
